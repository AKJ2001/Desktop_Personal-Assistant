# Desktop_Personal-Assistant
This Software aims at developing a personal assistant for Windows based operating
systems. The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain
commands, provided in either of the ways, speech or text. It will ease most of the work
of the user as a complete task can be done on a single command. Our project draws its
inspiration from Virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows and Siri for iOS. Users can
interact with the assistant either through voice commands or keyboard input.
The main objective is to make a voice assistant which is helpful to the physically disabled
persons, which makes them easy to access their personal devices much comfortably and
more secure without help of external agents.
